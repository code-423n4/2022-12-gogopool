[12/20/2022 07:23] SpaceCake#8961
I have managed to run the local Hardhat network using `just node` and deploy the contracts with `just deploy-base` then `just deploy`. I can see the resources being created in both the commands output, and the Hardhat server.
Is  there a way for me to interact with my local blockchain easily? Can I have a blockchain explorer?
I have tried to use ganache through the `hardhat-ganache` extension but to no avail (https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/other-guides/ganache-tests)
I have also noticed a mention of https://panopticon.fly.dev in the `.env` file. Is that related?

`MinipoolManager.sol` for Node Operators, and `TokenggAVAX.sol` for liquid staking


[12/20/2022 15:18] memerson
Instead of `deploy-base` then `deploy` you can just run `just setup-evm` which will take you through all the setup steps https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/Justfile#L42

You're right about https://panopticon.fly.dev, if you switch that in the top right to "hardhat" you can see the state of the local blockchain. Panopticon doesn't do any interacting, just viewing. 

To interact with the local chain we created hardhat tasks that hit contract methods. You can run a task with `just task <name_of_task>` . There are two scenario files that take you through a full cycle of operation using these tasks https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/scenarios/Full%20Cycle%20One%20User.md

This might be a dumb question or I‚Äôm just blind. But where in the code does someone become a node operator? I‚Äôm assuming guardian has to be the one to set it. But I can‚Äôt find where that is in the project.


[12/20/2022 23:35] johnnygault
Anyone can become a node operator by staking GGP then calling `createMinipool`  ,and sending 1000 AVAX. There is no way for C-Chain solidity code to "check" that an actual validator node exists etc. All we can do is get the user's supplied NodeID, and then we issue the validation tx on the P-Chain that promotes that nodeID to an Avalanche Validator. If the nodeID is invalid or does not exist, everything works, it just wont recv a reward and then GoGoPool would slash their GGP to compensate.

Perhaps out of scope but still important context. Could you point to a tech primier on Avax staking ?


[12/23/2022 16:11] johnnygault
We used RocketPool as inspiration, but since eth staking and avalanche staking are so different, we diverged quite a bit. We kept the storage model they used, which has worked out great.

If the multisig is disabled, where is the code for reassigning the minipool to the new multisig?


[12/26/2022 15:25] johnnygault
It is used when registering the node ID as a validator on Avalanche. Any user can delegate to any node id and get rewarded minus the delegation fee which can be 2% - 100%


[12/26/2022 15:29] johnnygault
doesn‚Äôt exist currently. We can‚Äôt really reassign once launched, the multisig has to finish out all minipools assigned to it. disable means the multisig would not get any new minipools.

The slashed GGP is transferred to ``ProtocolDAO``, how will liquid stakers claim these slashed GGP?


[12/29/2022 18:18] johnnygault
Since slashing is fairly uncommon on Avalanche, we will have the ProtocolDAO periodically sell accumulated GGP for AVAX to give liquid stakers.


[12/29/2022 18:33] vankys
Hi. Can somebody explain what is the purpose of the 'duration' property of the minipool?


[12/29/2022 18:37] johnnygault
`Duration` is for the nodeOp to say how long they want their node to be a validator. Avalanche protocol requires it to be between 14-365 days. Behind the scenes, Rialto will cycle each minipool every 14 days so that rewards continually flow into the protocol. In the future we can see a path where the DAO can ladder the maturities to maximize yield and still maintain liquidity for ggAVAX.


[12/29/2022 18:45] vankys
Thank you! Does that mean duration = endTime - startTime in the MinipoolManager?


[12/29/2022 18:45] chaduke#3730

Another question: does the rewardsPool own all the GGP initially (via the vault)? Otherwise, who and how the GGP is sent to rewardsPool?


[12/30/2022 18:14] johnnygault
When the GGP token is deployed, we will distr it appropriately, including sending some to the rewardsPool.


[12/30/2022 18:14] chaduke#3730
ok, thanks


[12/30/2022 20:22] johnnygault
To clarify `duration` for everyone -- a nodeOp can choose a duration they want, from 14 days to 365 days. But behind the scenes, Rialto will *only* create a validator for 14 days. At the end of the 14 days, the Avalanche protocol pays out the validation rewards and all funds are returned to the contracts, which divvy up the rewards between liq stakers and nodeops. If the `duration` still has time left to go, Rialto will call `recreateMinipool` which will do another 14 days cycle( if it can considering GGP collat and available liq staker funds), compounding the rewards. In this way, the protocol recvs yield from every minipool every 14 days, and the collat ratio of GGP can never get more than 14 days out of whack. In the future we see a path for laddering maturities to maximize yield and still provide necessary liq for stakers.

@ju1ie | gogopool @JohnnyGault are you available?


[01/01/2023 15:47] gz627
@memerson In Known Issues:"GGP Rewards Manipulation Before Distribution" - This can only be taken advantage of when signing up for 2-4 week validation periods. Our protocol is incentivizing nodes to sign up for 3-12 month validation periods.
What is the actual incentive?


[01/01/2023 16:23] ustas.eth
What is Rialto? Where we can find the docs or sources?


[01/01/2023 16:36] johnnygault
it‚Äôs an MPC system that handles the Avalanche specific functions. Rialtosimulator.sol shows t you what contracts it interacts with.

If a node operator creates a minipool with a duration of 180 days, is it possible for the node operator quit after, say 90 days?


[01/01/2023 17:11] johnnygault
no, but the cycle could stop based on some factors like ggp collat ratio falling too low, or there not being enough liq staker funds.


[01/01/2023 17:12] gz627
Thanks!


[01/01/2023 17:12] Franfran#5067
Though the liquid stakers funds are taken upon the starting of the validator period isn't it ?


[01/01/2023 17:13] Franfran#5067
So it's locked it shouldn't stop the validation


[01/01/2023 17:15] johnnygault
each cycle, all the funds are moved back to the C chain and divvyed up, then the cycle starts again. there could be edge cases where there is not enough avax to start another cycle

[01/01/2023 17:16] gz627
is it possible for a minipool to get started if the duration is less than 14 days?


[01/01/2023 17:17] Franfran#5067
Nodes on Avalanche have a minumum of 14 days afaik


[01/01/2023 17:18] Franfran#5067
For validation


[01/01/2023 17:18] Franfran#5067
In order to yield some rewards


[01/01/2023 17:18] johnnygault
no avalanche required 14 days min

[01/02/2023 16:48] 0xbtk
Does the TokenGGP price remain constant?


[01/02/2023 17:00] johnnygault
Rialto will act as an Oracle to set the price in the initial bootstrap phase of the Protocol.


[01/02/2023 17:31] 0xbtk
And if the GGP collateral ratio drops below 10%, what will happen?


[01/02/2023 17:45] johnnygault
Every 2 weeks the minipool is recreated, if GGP collat is too low, the minipool will not be recreated, and the nodeop can either stake more ggp, or withdraw their funds.


[01/02/2023 18:11] 0xbtk
ok thanks

Looks like there was a lot to look for here, and I just did gas because of the holidays. And even, could not pass the gas score barrier for the first time.


[02/09/2023 17:31] matin6517
After centuries of waiting, just got $57.2 ü•πüî´


[02/09/2023 17:38] pfapostol
Yes, it's always best to participate in many contests and never rely on any particular one. It's like poker, you can only guess what cards are in the hands of the rest and what rewards you might get.

I want to know something .. I submitted one issue for Gas Optimization and I'm sure It's valid Finding, Why I didn't get paid for this ? I'm asking to know what is my mistake for this


[02/09/2023 17:44] pfapostol
probably below the minimum score.


[02/09/2023 17:44] .daredev1l
It was i++ , but how to know about the minimum score?


[02/09/2023 17:45] pfapostol
i++ is out of scope, if it was only it, score is probably zero üòÄ


[02/09/2023 17:46] .daredev1l
okey nice, how to know about calculation for the score of Gas Optimizations ? to be accepted


[02/09/2023 17:46] Franfran#5067
it has probably been found by the static analyzer


[02/09/2023 17:47] pfapostol
Points are counted by the judges, and if you are not a backstage, all that remains is to trust them. Or sometimes you can ask them.


[02/09/2023 17:48] .daredev1l

@russell | dAppling.network @0xWeiss you will be able to see the results, decisions once the report is published and the findings repo is made public.

Judging so many issues and resolving all queries must have been very hard. Great job @Alex The Entreprenerd üôå


[02/10/2023 03:39] CharlesPal#0309
7th place for first contest and 60% coverage is decent I think?

@memerson @ju1ie | gogopool 

Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well. I was just wondering if there's a way to view the results of the bug bounty? I'm really excited to learn from the results and see what vulnerabilities were discovered.

I also wanted to take a moment to thank all the fellow participants who took part in the bounty. Your hard work and dedication are truly appreciated. Together, we made gogopool more secure and helped protect users. Thank you all for your efforts!

C4 staff will publish the report on the code4rena.com website when it's ready for publication. It's in progress, but the sponsor team was running a mitigation review prior to publication.

Hi all! @Alex The Entreprenerd and myself are thinking of hosting an Office Hours session to go over this competition. If you're a Warden who participated that would like to talk through your findings with us (to ask questions, see how you could've improved the submission etc) live in the session, please react with a üëãüèª  emoji.

If you know you can't make it to the live, feel free to drop your finding and questions in this thread, we'll address them after talking to the people that join live

Hi @Alex The Entreprenerd , we have participated in gogopool contest as team by name "Web3Tech_Team" .But we do not find our name in warden list.We shared gas related findings.We had participated in 2-3 more contest.But our name never came in participated warden list.Maybe something wrong we are doing while submiting the  GAS FINDING report which we should be aware of? Is it true that while submitting the GAS related finding we have to mention like how much GAS we are saving ?

In order for your report to be awarded you must receive a B score, that is dependent on the quality and amount of savings that other reports offer, you should go in the report and compare yours with other that have been awarded

You can also check Office Hours which we did for this contest:
